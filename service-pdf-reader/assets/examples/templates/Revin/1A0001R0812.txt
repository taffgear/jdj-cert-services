Uncertainty
+ 0.035 % of full scale with use of correction figures in the range of 0 - 100 % of full scale
The reported uncertainty is based on a standard uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor of k = 2,
which provides a confidence level of approximately 95 %.
The standard uncertainty has been determined in accordance with document EA-4/02.
Calculated by software revision: 2.7.6.6/2.44
Traceability
The measurements have been executed using standards for which the traceability to
(inter)national standards has been demonstrated towards the RvA.
